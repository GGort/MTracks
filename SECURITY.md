# Security Policy

## Project Status: Pre-Alpha

**MTracks** is currently in a **pre-alpha** stage of development, and there are no active releases at this time. The project is still under active development, and features, code, and architecture may change frequently. While we are committed to ensuring the security of the project, please be aware that security practices may evolve as the project matures.

## Reporting Security Issues

We take security seriously, even during the early stages of development. If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it responsibly using GitHub's built-in tools.

### To report a security issue:

1. **Do not open a public issue.** Instead, use GitHubâ€™s private security vulnerability reporting feature.
    - Navigate to the **Security** tab of this repository.
    - Click on **Report a vulnerability** to submit your report privately.
2. In your report, please include:
    - A description of the vulnerability.
    - Steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
    - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
    - Any possible mitigations or fixes you suggest.

We will review your report as soon as possible and work with you to verify and address the vulnerability.

## Security in Pre-Alpha

Since **MTracks** is in pre-alpha, please note the following:
- The codebase may not yet have undergone extensive security reviews or audits.
- New features are still being developed, and security might not yet be fully implemented or tested for all parts of the system.
- There are no guarantees of stability or security at this stage, and we recommend not using this software in a production environment until it reaches a stable release.

## Future Security Measures

As **MTracks** moves toward a stable release, we plan to:
- Perform security audits of critical components.
- Implement formal security processes and procedures.
- Provide regular security updates and patches as necessary.

We will update this security policy to reflect any changes in security practices as the project evolves.

## Public Disclosure

If a security vulnerability is reported and verified, we will issue an advisory and a patch to resolve the issue before any public disclosure. We request that any security vulnerabilities be disclosed responsibly in coordination with our team.

Thank you for helping us keep **MTracks** safe!
